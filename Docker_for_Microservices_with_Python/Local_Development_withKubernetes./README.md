Chapter 6
=======

The code in this chapter includes the three microservices for the example, Thoughts Backend, Users Backend and Frontend, each in its own subdirectory.

On each of the subdirectories, there's a `docker-compose.yaml` file to operate the service, and a `kubernetes` subdirectory with the configuration for each microservice.
